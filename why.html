    <h1>Why you should read!</h1>
    <h4>1. Reading is good for your brain</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>“Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.” 
            Joseph Addison penned this quote roughly 300 years ago, before modern science and research equipment could back up his claim. 
            Today, however, scientific studies show that reading does make you smarter. 
            Reading a novel, for example, increases the blood flow and improves connectivity in the brain.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>2. Reading introduces you to new ideas and invites you to solve problems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you ever solved a case in a mystery book before you read the conclusion or predicted a turn of events in a novel? 
            Your analytical thinking was stimulated merely from reading. 
            Reading helps you detect patterns, solve problems, and assimilate new information as if you were living in the characters’ shoes.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>3. Reading improves your conversational skills</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Because reading increases your vocabulary and your knowledge of how to correctly use new words, 
            reading helps you clearly articulate what you want to say. 
            The knowledge you gain from reading also gives you lots to talk about with others. 
            I love talking to people - especially little kids - who read a lot. 
            Their conversation tends to be deep, and it makes me grin when little ones use fancy words they found in a book.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>4. Reading strengthens worldview and convictions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>When you read a book with a concurring worldview, it reinforces your convictions. 
            If you read a book with an opposing worldview, 
            it broadens your perspective and causes you to examine your beliefs and search for truth. </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>5. Reading improves your self-discipline and consistency</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>With the modern barrage of media and instant technological information, 
            our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter. 
            Reading a book, unlike skimming a web page, forces you to focus. 
            To get the most out of a story, you must fixate on the plot and complete the book. 
            In doing this, your brain forms deep connections and practices concentration.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>6. Reading increases cultural knowledge (without an expensive plane flight)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading books set in cultures different from our own 
            provides knowledge of those cultures and the emotional and spiritual lives of the people who live there. 
            I hope to travel the world someday, but until then I’m exploring through books. 
            I’ve gained a deeper understanding of cultures through reading: 
            stories of hammock beds, cannibals, burqas, and Uganda’s red dirt stand out stark in my brain. 
            I’ve not yet been to these cultures, but I understand them better because of reading. </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>7. Reading inspires you</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading a good book is like being around an inspiring person. 
            You observe inspiring actions, feel contagious passion, and desire to live a better life. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>8. Reading reduces stress</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reading about something you enjoy or losing yourself in a good novel is an excellent way to relax. 
            It can ease tension in your muscles and heart while letting your brain wander to new ideas and live in someone else’s shoes. 
            Reading is a mini vacation for your brain! </li>
    </ul>
